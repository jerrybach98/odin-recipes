  <p>This is a savory steak with the slight sweetness of caramelized onions and the earthiness of truffle oil. I would serve this with some mashed goat cheese and a nice green veggie. This recipe could be for 2, you and your honey! A nice Cabernet would pair well, but I like so many that it's hard to choose. Cheers.</p>
    
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, divided</li>
  <li>3 large white onions, sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
  <li>½ cup butter, room temperature</li>
  <li>1 small shallot, minced</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon white truffle oil</li>
  <li>2 (14 ounce) Black Angus ribeye steaks</li>
  <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are dark and soft, about 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Mix butter, shallot, and truffle oil in a bowl until blended. Refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Preheat an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Season steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. Cook steaks until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
  <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and bake until steaks are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 4 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest in the skillet, covered, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Slice steaks and transfer to serving plates. Cover with onions; top with a slice of truffle butter.</li>
  </ol>
