  <p>Way better than normal egg tarts. Will be gone within seconds.</p>
    
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>cooking spray</li>
  <li>1 (11 ounce) package pie crust mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
  <li>⅓ cup ice cold water</li>
  <li>4 egg yolks</li>
  <li>⅓ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
  <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
  <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
  <li>3 drops vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
  <li>Place the pie crust mix into a bowl, and lightly rub the butter and water into the mix until the mixture holds together well enough to form a ball. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead several times to make the dough more elastic. Form into a ball again, and cut the ball in half; cut each half into half again (4 pieces); cut each quarter into thirds to make 12 total pieces. Roll the pieces into balls, and set aside.</li>
  <li>Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, cream, milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl until light and foamy, about 3 minutes; strain the filling through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl.</li>
  <li>Press a dough ball into the bottom and about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of a prepared muffin cup; repeat for remaining dough pieces. Spoon each crust about 80 percent full of the egg yolk mixture.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crusts are golden brown, the filling is set, and the tarts are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
